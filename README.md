# 📘 Study Vault: Upload, Discover & Empower Student Learning Instantly

Study Vault is a full-stack MERN application designed to solve the real-world problem of ineffective note-sharing among students. Traditionally, students rely on social media messengers like WhatsApp or Telegram to exchange study materials, but these platforms are not built for academic resource management—notes get mixed up with unrelated messages, important files are lost in group chats, and there is no mechanism to judge the quality of content. Study Vault addresses this by offering a dedicated platform where students can securely upload notes, organize resources, and explore materials shared by peers. Each uploaded file can be downloaded in just a few clicks, while a built-in 5-star rating system and commenting feature enable peer-based quality evaluation, ensuring that the best resources stand out. On the backend, the platform uses OTP-based authentication for secure sign-ups, Cloudinary for scalable and lightning-fast file delivery, and a clean MVC architecture with route protection, input validation, and custom error handling for reliability. By combining security, scalability, and collaborative features, Study Vault not only streamlines academic resource sharing but also builds a trustworthy knowledge ecosystem that helps students learn faster, smarter, and together.

### Working

The **Study Vault** project streamlines the process of sharing and accessing academic resources through a secure and user-friendly platform. Here’s how it works:

1. **User Registration & Verification**
   - New users sign up with their email and password.
   - An OTP is sent to their email for verification, ensuring only genuine users gain access.
   - Passwords are securely hashed before storage.

2. **Login & Authentication**
   - Users log in using their credentials.
   - JWT tokens are issued for secure, persistent sessions.

3. **Uploading Resources**
   - Authenticated users can upload notes and study materials (PDFs).
   - Files are validated and uploaded directly to Cloudinary for fast, reliable storage.
   - Users can add metadata (title, subject, semester, description) to make resources easily discoverable.

4. **Resource Management**
   - Users have a personal dashboard to view, edit, or delete their uploaded study resources.
   - All actions are protected to ensure only the owner can modify their content.

5. **Exploring & Downloading**
   - Anyone (even without an account) can browse, search, and filter the study resources by title, subject, semester, or description.
   - Resources are displayed with details and can be downloaded instantly via secure Cloudinary links.

6. **Review & Rating System**
   - Logged-in users can rate resources (1–5 stars) to help others assess quality.
   - Ratings are displayed for each resource.

7. **Security & Validation**
   - All forms are validated on backend using Joi to prevent invalid data.
   - API endpoints are protected, with authorization.

8. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Pagination ensures fast browsing even with a large number of resources.
   - Cloudinary integration guarantees quick file delivery and scalability.

In summary, Study Vault offers a seamless, secure, and efficient way for students to share and discover study materials, empowering collaborative learning and academic success.
